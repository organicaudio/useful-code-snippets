If you've ever customized your app icons or played around with Shortcuts (previously called Workflow), you probably know how important URL scheme names are. Nearly all iOS apps assign themselves one of these names, and you need to know them if you want to add custom icons to your home screen or create a Shortcuts workflow that opens an app on your iPhone up.
Finding the URL scheme name, also known as a URI scheme, for a particular app is not easy. First, you have to download the IPA file for the app — a difficult task since the iTunes 12.7 update removed iOS apps from it. When you finally find the IPA, you have to turn it into a ZIP file, show the contents of the app package, then hunt for the specific PLIST file that contains the URL schemes. It's a lot of work.

This example shows the URL schemes for VSCO in one of its PLIST files.
You can take some of the work out of digging through IPAs by downloading the extract-scheme-url.sh script on your Mac and running bash extract-scheme-url.sh AppName.ipa in a terminal window in the directory where those files are.
As for the IPAs, the easiest way to download IPA files is to use Apple Configurator 2. After signing in and connecting your iPhone, you can view and update apps that need it. Any apps you update this way will be stored temporarily in an Apple Config folder in the "Group Containers" folder in your user library. But it's still a lot of work and requires that the app you need has an update you can apply.

If all you want to do is create a custom app icon or open the Netflix app from a workflow you're toying with, we'll try to make things as easy as possible for you by listing below all of the URL scheme names for apps that we know of right now. Also, when we come across them, we'll not only include the "open" schemes, but some deep links URL schemes to jump to specific tasks inside an app.
While the list below may seem small considering there are over 2 million apps in the App Store, it's a work in progress, and we'll keep adding to it as we discover more URL schemes for popular apps and games on iPhone.

Quick Guide to Using URL Schemes in Shortcuts
Before moving on to the list, let's do a quick lesson on using URL schemes in the Shortcuts app. When iOS 13 came out, Shortcuts removed the need to use any "open" URL schemes since it added a new "Open App" script that will let you choose any app on your iPhone. That makes things so much easier.
Still, if you prefer the old way, want to use deep links, or want to know the base URL scheme to investigate for possible deep links, check out the first screenshot below. You input the URL scheme into the "URL" web action, then use the "Open URLs" web action below it to perform the task. It's essentially the same as using the "Open App" script seen in the second screenshot below.


URL schemes are more handy for deep links where you want to perform a specific action. As seen below, you can see I'm opening up the "Customize Controls" settings in the "Control Center" preferences.


URL Schemes for Popular iOS Apps & Services
Any ones below without anything after the :// are just schemes to open the apps up, while ones with information after the :// are for performing "deep link" specific actions within the apps. Also, while all of the below include the :// in them, most can be used with just : instead of with the // symbols.
Keep in mind that developers may change the URL schemes for their apps at any time. Apple has done so for certain iOS services, such as links to specific settings, with each new iOS update (iOS 11, iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, etc.). Some URL schemes you can probably even guess since a lot just use their app's name as the scheme name. Trial and error!
Schemes for the Settings app (listed below) are merely paths to Settings menus. Apple restricts schemes from being able to toggle switches on and off, select different features from a list, and so on. It does so for security purposes, so that runaway apps or shortcuts don't alter your settings without you realizing it.
Also, anything below that starts with fb*:// are Facebook deep links that should work whether or not you have Facebook installed on your device. Since they don't always work as expected, we've only included them in the list below if they had no other URL scheme name. Otherwise, fb*:// schemes are omitted.

* See 'Fantastical' app below for an example of a URL scheme
  you can run from within Drafts.

* See MacStories' article on using Drafts to create custom
  actions with URL schemes and custom Drafts tags like
  [[draft]], [[title]], [[clipboard]], and [[line|..n]].
  It's an older article but very much applicable today, and
  it goes over custom Drafts URL schemes in detail.

* Bangs do not work in URL schemes from Shortcuts.
  At least, I haven't gotten them to work. They do
  work in URL schemes of other browsers, like Safari,
  Chrome, and Firefox, but not all. You can view all
  bangs at https://duckduckgo.com/bang.

  Bang examples for Null Byte's site:
  Safari: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!nullbyte+kali+linux
  Chrome: googlechrome://duckduckgo.com/?q=!nullbyte+kali+linux
  Firefox: firefox://open-url?url=https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!nullbyte+kali+linux

* URL parameters also do not work in URL schemes
  from Shortcuts. Again, I haven't been able to
  get them working. They do work in URL schemes
  of other browsers, like Safari and Chrome, but
  not all (Firefox is troublesome). You can view
  all parameters at https://duckduckgo.com/params.

If you know the URL scheme name or action to an app not featured here, let us know. We encourage the support of our community to help us build this list up!
Also, it's worth noting that Apple has been trying to wean developers off URL schemes since iOS 9.2 in favor of universal links, but URL schemes are nowhere near dead. And with Apple turning Workflow into its own Shortcuts app starting in iOS 12, an app that even has its own scheme, there's no reason to believe URL schemes are going away anytime soon.
